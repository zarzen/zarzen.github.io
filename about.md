I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University. I am good at applying/implementing Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Neural Networks models. I am particularly interested in how and when a learning model could fail or success. 

I am looking for a job position related to Machine Learning/Deep Learning engineering.
